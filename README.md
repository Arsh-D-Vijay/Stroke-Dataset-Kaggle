# Stroke-Dataset-Kaggle
A detailed inspection on factors leading to a person having stroke.
The dataset constituted of 12 features, id, and label with 5110 enteries, with some missing values in bmi column
Firstly, I have Inspected the dataset and made modeifications where it was needed. 
Then, I have done an EDA analysis on the given dataset and provided my fruitfull insights at each steps and finally concluded it with a short summary.
After that, I have created an ML model that uses the features from dataset to predict if a person has a stroke or not.
For ML model creation I have tired 3 algorithms and finally presented the best as the output with accuracy of 94.2% on test case.
